Stock Price Prediction Using LSTM Neural Networks ðŸ“ˆ
This repository contains a mini-project focused on predicting stock prices using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. It demonstrates how deep learning can be applied to time-series data, specifically using historical stock prices of Tesla (TSLA).
ðŸ“‹ Project Overview
Stock price prediction is a complex yet insightful task that combines the challenges of financial forecasting with the capabilities of deep learning. This project builds an LSTM-based model to analyze past stock price trends and predict future values.

Key Highlights:
Data Preprocessing:
Data cleaning and handling missing values.
Feature scaling for normalized input to the model.
Splitting data into training and testing sets.
Model Architecture:
LSTM layers with dropout regularization.
Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the loss function.
Adam optimizer for training.
Visualization:
Comparison of actual vs. predicted stock prices.
Insights into model performance using plots.
ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
Data Processing: Pandas, NumPy
Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
