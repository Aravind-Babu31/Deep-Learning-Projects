This repository focuses on **predicting stock prices** using **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** neural networks, specifically for Tesla (TSLA). The project demonstrates the application of deep learning to time-series forecasting, with features like **data preprocessing** (cleaning, scaling, and splitting), LSTM architecture with dropout regularization, and **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** as the loss function. The model provides insights through **visualizations of actual vs. predicted prices**, highlighting the importance of preprocessing and LSTMâ€™s ability to handle sequential data. Technologies include Python, TensorFlow/Keras, Pandas, and Matplotlib for analysis and visualization.
